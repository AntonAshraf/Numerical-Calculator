# Numerical Methods Calculator

This is a Python program that implements various numerical methods for finding roots of equations. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) built using the Tkinter library.
To have a local test without installing the dependencies, you can **Download** the executable file from _[here](https://bit.ly/3Qnn3nx)_ ⬇️, to make sure that it will work in your computer close the security protection or add the file to the exceptions.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Matplotlib library
- Sympy library
- Tkinter library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## How to Run

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command to start the program:

```python main.py``` or ```python3 main.py```

## Usage

1. Select a numerical method from the dropdown menu.
2. Enter the equation in the "Enter f(x)" field. Use the `^` symbol for exponentiation.
3. Enter the required parameters based on the selected method.
4. Click the "Calculate" button to find the root of the equation.
5. The program will display the root, error, and additional information.

## Numerical Methods

The program supports the following numerical methods:

- Bisection
- False Position
- Secant
- Newton-Raphson
- Simple Fixed-Point Iteration

Each method has different requirements for input parameters. Make sure to fill in the appropriate fields based on the selected method.
